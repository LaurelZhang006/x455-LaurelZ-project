                  This project, in 2022, involved designing the main visual and
                  a set of conference materials for the Forum of Moral
                  Development, organized by the Institute for Moral Development
                  at Southeast University in Nanjing, China. This marked the
                  third consecutive year I was entrusted with the visual design
                  for their conference. The conference theme focused on pressing
                  social issues such as the influence of industrial and
                  high-tech developments, requiring a thoughtful and impactful
                  visual approach. To achieve this, I utilized AI generation to
                  craft an innovative and cohesive visual identity that enhanced
                  the forumâ€™s professional atmosphere and facilitated a seamless
                  attendee experience. The items included a main visual display
                  framework, pull-up banners, conference manual, name cards,
                  guest passes, and ID badges.

                  This project is one of our long-term collaborations with Yu
                  Yuan Garden, involving the design of an annual park membership
                  card. The product includes sections for Yu Yuan Garden's
                  introduction, four discount coupons, one admission ticket, and
                  the annual membership card. A unified product structure is
                  essential, ensuring physical connections between each section.
                  The challenge lies in creating a design that meets functional
                  requirements while enhancing the user experience through
                  thoughtful design elements and high-quality materials,
                  reflecting the beauty and cultural significance of Yu Yuan
                  Garden.

                  Starting from July 2017, I spearheaded a non-profit initiative
                  focused on multilingual exchange activities in Nanjing, which
                  quickly grew into one of the largest language exchange events
                  in the region. Over the course of two years, I established and
                  led a dedicated team of 20 volunteers, orchestrating a wide
                  range of activities and interactions that fostered
                  cross-cultural communication and understanding. Unfortunately,
                  the event had to be suspended in 2020 due to the COVID-19
                  pandemic. Throughout its operation, my responsibilities
                  extended beyond organizing the events; I was actively involved
                  in designing numerous promotional materials to effectively
                  communicate our mission and engage participants. Additionally,
                  I took charge of scripting, conducting interviews, and
                  coordinating on-site activities for video shoots, which were
                  carried out by a team of volunteer photographers. This
                  comprehensive involvement ensured the event's smooth execution
                  and the effective dissemination of our message.

                  The project highlights an extensive range of promotional and
                  exhibition posters created for the Nanjing Qinhuai District
                  Library over a five-year period, from 2019 to 2024. These
                  posters were designed to support various library events,
                  programs, and exhibitions, reflecting the library's commitment
                  to community engagement and cultural enrichment. Each poster
                  was meticulously crafted to capture the essence of the events
                  and exhibitions, using compelling visuals and informative
                  content to attract and inform the public. This body of work
                  demonstrates our dedication to producing high-quality,
                  impactful designs that enhance the library's presence and
                  outreach within the community.
